#
# Example of firewall - 2 interfaces.
#
#  One facing the internal network, one facing internet  
#
#  Services:
#    2 kinds of services are allowed for:
#
#     - self services 
#       These are on the firewall itself. 
#       E.g. border mail, dns and ssh.
#
#     - forwarded services
#       These are provided by servers on the internal network.
#        E.g. web server, vpn, server, 
#
#  NAT:
#    Internal network is NAT'd out.
#
#
#  Blocks:
#
#  We also support IP blocks from set of CIDRs. These are provided in separate file(s).
#  blocks come in 2 flavors:
#       - inet 
#         These are the usual blocks for inbound (SYN) packets but do allow replies
#         to come back from these IPs if originated by us.
#
#       - netdev
#         These are blocked very early and are 'full' blocks. They are not allowed back in
#         not SYN nor Established/Related. You won't get a reply at all not even a ping.
#
#  Whitelist
#    - whitelist inet blocks
#
# After install use by:
#   systemctl enable nftables
#   systemctl start nftables
#
#   Manual
#       Use     : nft -f /etc/nftables.conf
#       Remove  : nft flush ruleset
# 
#   Check   : 
#       nft -c -f /etc/nftables.conf
#
#   Install:
#       - Edit nftables.conf 
#           - interfaces, internal and external, match your own.
#           - change services artc as needed.
#
#       - Edit set files in etc/nftables.d/
#           - filter_sets
#
#       - check 
#           Please run a 'check'. 
#
#       - Save any existing rules: 
#          mv /etc/nftables.conf /etc/nftables.conf.orig
#
#       - Copy rules 
#           mkdir /etc/nftables.d
#           rsync -a nftables.conf /etc/
#           rsync -a etc/nftables.d /etc/nftables.d/
#
#           systemctl restart nftables
#
# Policy used is that nothing is allowed unless it is explicitly allowed by rules.
# Obviously adjust as needed :)
#
#  NB.
#  Flush, and turn off remove any legacy iptables rules before using nftbales.
# 
#  systemctl stop iptables; systemctl disable iptables
#  systemctl enable nftables
#
#  - Adding new blocks:
#     Add whatever CIDR blocks to the blocks files and restart
#     systemctl restart nftables
#
#  N.B. Sets are local to each table. i.e not shareable across tables
#       See nftables documentation.
